# Made to Share Recipe Online Recipe Shearing Site 

## User Experience:

### Project Goals:

The goal of this project is to create a nice, healthy recipe sharing website that is also suitable for people on Keto diet.
The target audience are homecooks, new cooks, those who love to share their creations and those who just started cooking or dieting, so basically everyone can benefit from the site. My passion is cooking and healthy cooking. That's why I created this site and I am also a qualified chef so recipes and pictures which I uploaded were already in my repertoar. 

#### User Goals:
**Generic**

* Easy to navigate website with amazing home cooked recipes
* Find food, that cooked by other “ordinary” people, that means everyone can recreate these recipes at home 
* Upload and take pride for those dishes that the user created 
* Search Breakfast, Main Meal, Snack, and Keto recipes (which also included in the other categories as well, because even diet food can be easy to make and very taste at the same time)
